                Footwork:
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are 3 types of footwork: Forward, backward and sideways.
       
            </p>
            <p>
                For forward footwork, you just have to take 1 or 2 long steps forward to reach the shuttle, while having enough time to get back to neutral position.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For backwards footwork, you can run, skip or chase the shuttle. You should pick the one that is most efficient to get to the shuttle.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For sideways footwork, the knees must be bent and legs at shoulder width. Keeping low allows the player to react quickly and moving as fast as possible.

                Griping the racket:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Forehand:
                Form a 'V' shape with thumb and index finger. Have a little space between your index finger and middle fingers. The fingers should be loosely around the grip
            </p>

            <p>
                Thumb/Backhand:
                Place thumb on wide part of grip with strings facing the floor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bevel:
                Same as backhand, but move the head anti-clockwise if right-handed such that strings are facing diagonally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Panhandle:
                Place thumb on the side of the racket, pinching the sides of the handle with the thumb and index finger.

                Strokes:
            </h3>

            <p>
                Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes.
                All strokes can be played either forehand or backhand. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. 
                Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading, whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading. 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Players play different strokes for different situations.
                In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads are weaker than forehands:
              
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The backhand clear is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since the precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court.
