                Grips:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Grips allows the player to have a comfortable surface to hold. There are many types of grips, with the most common being synthetic grips and towel grips. 
                Synthetic grips usually are better suited for less sweaty players, as it is a smoother grip.
                Towel grips are better for more sweaty players, as it is designed to absorb the sweat, making it not as slippery.
                Synthetic grips are thinner than towel grips.

            <h3>
                Strings:
            </h3>
            <p>
                After playing for some time, the strings in a badminton racket may get worn, so it is important to restring it occasionally.
                There are 3 types of strings: Power, control and durability.

                Racket Frames:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Rackets, or racquets, are light, weighing about 70 to 95 grams.
                A racket frame consists of a head, throat, shaft, as well as a handle. 
                They are usually made of carbon fibre, titanium or steel. However, with advances in technology, newer rackets use nanomaterials for greater durability.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 2 types of shafts: Flexible and stiff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flexible shafts offer more power but lack the speed in executing a badminton shot, as well as accuracy in racket placement.
                With stiff shafts, there is a trade-off, losing power but gaining speed of return a shuttle and increasing the accuracy of shots.

                Shuttlecocks:
            </h3>
            <p>
                A shuttlecock, or shuttle in short, is a high-drag projectile, with an open conical shape. The cone is formed from 16 overlapping feathers embedded into a round cork-base. 
                The cork is covered with thin leather or synthetic material. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. 
                These nylon shuttles can be made either using natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt.

            <h3>
                Shoes:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Badminton shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar high-grip, non-marking material.
                Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little lateral support. 
                Badminton requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the feet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. 
                One of the most prominent figures in badminton is Yonex, a Japanese sports equipment manufacturing company.
