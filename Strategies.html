            <h3>Singles:</h3>
            <p>Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. 

            </p>

            <p>
                Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. 
                Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up their effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return.
               
                
            </p>

            <p>
                Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium. 
            </p>

            <p>
                However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.
                In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.   
           
            </p>

            <p>
                At high levels of play, singles demand extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.

            <h3>Doubles:</h3>
            <p>
                Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. 
                Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court, and their partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. 
                
            </p>
                
            <p>
                If the rear court attacker plays a drop shot, their partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. 
                If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. 
                In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.
               
            </p>

            <p>
                At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. 
                The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                Doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. 
                Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.

            <h3>Mixed doubles:</h3>

            <p>
                In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. 
                This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can, therefore, produce smashes that are more powerful. 
                
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. 
                In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.
               
            </p>

            <p>
                At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. 
                When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.
